# Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5

## Question
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Explanation
This mathematical problem asks us to:

1. **Find Qualifying Numbers**
- Look for all numbers less than 1000
- Select numbers that are divisible by either 3 OR 5
- Include numbers divisible by both (like 15, 30, etc.) only once

2. **Example Demonstration (below 10)**
- Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9
- Multiples of 5: 5
- Total sum: 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23

3. **Main Task**
- Apply the same logic to numbers below 1000
- Find all numbers that are:
  - Multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, ..., 999)
  - Multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, ..., 995)
- Calculate their sum

The final answer should be a single number: 233168

```
# Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
sum_multiples = 0
for i in range(1000):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        sum_multiples += i
print(sum_multiples)
```

# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Question
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Explanation
This problem requires us to:

1. **Generate Fibonacci Sequence**
- Start with 1 and 2
- Each number is sum of previous two
- Continue until reaching 4 million
- Example sequence start: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...

2. **Filter Numbers**
- Only consider even numbers in the sequence
- Even numbers from start: 2, 8, 34, ...
- Stop when reaching 4 million

3. **Main Task**
- Generate Fibonacci numbers up to 4 million
- Select only even numbers
- Calculate their sum and print it

The solution requires writing code that efficiently generates Fibonacci numbers while tracking and summing only the even values.
